/**
 * A focused, transactional input cursor handed to {@link ArgumentType#parse}
 * during command tree traversal. The cursor exposes the run of raw input
 * tokens that the tree has allocated to a specific argument and lets the
 * argument type consume them at its own pace.
 *
 * <h2>Design rules</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Token-level only.</b> The cursor never exposes character-level
 *       navigation, parameter-list awareness, or pathway shape. Argument types
 *       that need character-level work (e.g. selector parsing) construct a
 *       {@code CharStream} from {@link #next()} themselves; the tree owns
 *       parameter-list and pathway concerns.</li>
 *   <li><b>Transactional snapshot/commit.</b> Argument types receive a
 *       detached {@link #snapshot}; advancing the snapshot does not affect
 *       the underlying stream. The tree commits the snapshot back via
 *       {@link #commitFrom} only on a successful parse, so a thrown exception
 *       cleanly rolls back partial advancement without any explicit reset.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>The token budget</h2>
 * The cursor's read range is bounded by a per-argument <b>token budget</b>
 * computed by the tree from {@link ArgumentType#getNumberOfParametersToConsume}
 * (or, for greedy types, from reservation/discrimination logic). Reading past
 * the budget yields {@code null} from {@link #peek}/{@link #nextOrNull} and
 * throws from {@link #next}. Argument types are expected to consume between 0
 * and {@code budget} tokens; the tree advances the underlying input by the
 * cursor's actual final position via {@link #commitFrom}.
 *
 * <h2>Snapshot / commit lifecycle</h2>
 * The framework's parse entry point follows this protocol:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Cursor<S> root = Cursor.of(ctx, allocatedTokens); // tree-side
 * Cursor<S> probe = root.snapshot();                // detached copy
 * try {
 *     T value = type.parse(ctx, arg, probe);       // user-side advances probe
 *     root.commitFrom(probe);                      // success → adopt position
 * } catch (CommandException ex) {
 *     // failure → drop probe, root keeps its original position
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * The {@code probe} given to user code shares the same immutable token list
 * as {@code root} but carries an independent mutable position. {@link #commitFrom}
 * verifies the same-source rule and copies the position over. Throwing from
 * {@code parse} cleanly rolls back: the framework simply discards {@code probe}.
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety contract</h2>
 * Implementations are <b>not thread-safe</b>. A cursor (including any
 * {@link #snapshot}) is bound to the thread that received it from the tree
 * and must not be shared with worker threads. In particular:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Do not hand a cursor or its snapshot to another thread.</b> Even
 *       though {@link #snapshot} produces a detached position, the parent
 *       cursor is also referenced by the tree, which reads {@link #position}
 *       immediately after {@code parse} returns to know how far to advance
 *       the underlying input stream. Worker mutations would race with that
 *       read and silently steal tokens from downstream arguments.</li>
 *   <li><b>For async / off-thread work, drain into a {@code List<String>}
 *       on the calling thread first</b>, then construct a fresh cursor for
 *       the worker via {@link #of}:
 *       <pre>{@code
 *       List<String> drained = new ArrayList<>();
 *       int n = innerType.getNumberOfParametersToConsume(arg);
 *       for (int i = 0; i < n && cursor.hasNext(); i++) drained.add(cursor.next());
 *       CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() ->
 *               innerType.parse(ctx, arg, Cursor.of(ctx, drained)));
 *       }</pre>
 *       This is exactly how {@code CompletableFutureArgument} hands work to
 *       a worker — the calling thread settles the budget commitment, the
 *       worker gets an isolated cursor over a frozen token list.</li>
 *   <li><b>Same applies to default-value resolution and value-flag parsing</b>
 *       — both construct dedicated cursors via {@link #single} / {@link #of}
 *       rather than reusing the parent walk's cursor.</li>
 * </ul>
